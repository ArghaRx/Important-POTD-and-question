Input: nums = [5,5,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The only possible polygon that can be made from nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]
Output: 12
Explanation: The polygon with the largest perimeter which can be made from nums has 5 sides: 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.
We cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as the longest side because it is not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them.
It can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.

class Solution {
    public long largestPerimeter(int[] nums) {
     Arrays.sort(nums);
     long total = 0;
     for(int i = nums.length - 1 ;i >= 0 ; i--)
     {
         total += nums[i];
     }   
    //  int cursum = 0;

     for(int j = nums.length - 1 ; j >= 0 ; j--)
     {
         if(total - nums[j] > nums[j]) return total;
         total -= nums[j];
     }
     return -1;
    }
}
